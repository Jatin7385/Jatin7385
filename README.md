#### A Computer Science and Engineering Student, exploring various domains in Tech, trying to find the right fit for myself. I love working on interesting problems and projects irrespective of the tech stack required. I don't specialize in a specific domain as of yet, but what I can do is work on problems and develop a solution for it which could be used by other people. I am an enthusiastic learner, and I prefer hands on learning.
